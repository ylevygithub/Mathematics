Projects : 101 pong, 102architect, 103cipher, 104intersection, 105torus.

The first part of this unit focuses on mathematical tools. This unit is a complementary introduction to programming (reviewing some of the Pool’s elements) and is also an introduction to scientific programming. 

TOPICS COVERED:
1° Linear algebra: vector analysis, matrix calculus.
2° Geometry: geometric transformations and coordinate systems.
3° Nonlinear equation solving.


Compétences à acquérir
A solid grasp on the basics of vector calculus and matric calculus.
Must show ability to master simple algorithms.

Each project includes a certain number of skills to be acquired (3 to 5).

You will be graded on the following:
-the number of skills validated
-the quality of Pitch presentations
-accuracy
